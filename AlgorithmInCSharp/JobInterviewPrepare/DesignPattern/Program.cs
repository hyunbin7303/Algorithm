        // Singleton Design Pattern
        /*
A singleton is a design pattern used when only one instance of an object is created and shared; that is, it only allows one instance of itself to be created. 
        Any attempt to create another instance simply returns a reference to the first one. Singleton classes are created by defining all class constructors as private.
        In addition, a private static member is created as the same type of the class, along with a public static member that returns an instance of the class. Here is a basic example:

        //Why are strings in C# immutable?
        // How are methods overload?
        /*
         * Methods are overloaded via different signatures (number of parameters and types). 
         * Thus, you can overload a method by having different data types, different number of parameters, or a different order of parameters.
