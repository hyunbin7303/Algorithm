In general, the running time of an algorithm or data strcture operation increases
with the input size, although it may also vary for different inputs of the same size.

Also, the running time is affected by the hardware engiornment in which the algorithm is implemented and executed. 


Because we are interested in the genneral dependence of running time on the size of the strcture of the input,
we should perform independent experiments on many different test inputs of various sizes.
