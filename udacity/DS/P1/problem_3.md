# Huffman coding
# Data Compression
# A data compression algorithm reduces the amount of memory (bits) required to represent a message.
# Assume that we have a string message [ ] comprising of 25 characters to be encoded.


# Hufmman coding assigns codes to characters such that the length of the code depends on the relative frequency or weight of the corresponding characters. 
# Huffman codes are of variable-length, and prefix-free (no code is prefix of any other). 
# Any prefix-free binary code can be visualized as a binary tree with the encoded characters stored at the leaves.
